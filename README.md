# Movie Trailer website
Project Overview

I wrote the server-side code to store a list of your favorite media (Movies/TV Shows, Music, & Games).  All media types inherit from base media class and implement additional attributes as needed.
The server-side code is then used to generate a static web page which allows visitors to browse and watch the trailers.

What I learned in this project

You will establish a foundation in core programming concepts using Python
Solidified my understanding of the role a web server plays in receiving a request, executing a block of code and generating a response.
